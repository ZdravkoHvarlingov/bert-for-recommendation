[The Incantations of Daniel Johnston] acknowledges the odd ways that society constructs culture and celebrity and how hard it can be to fully capture a life, especially when that person is famous, or \"cult famous,\" as the case may be. But as McClanahan and Cavolo struggle to show the heart of a man who himself struggles to make art and live his life, they show their hearts as well--big, red, and beating.\" --A.V. Club The Incantations of Daniel Johnston is a spirited, eye-popping collaborationg between New York Times-bestselling Spanish artist Ricardo Cavolo and award-winning author Scott McClanahan. Long a fan of Daniel Johnston, the man and his music, Cavolo illustrates Johnston's colorful life, from his humble beginnings as a carnival employee to folk musician in Austin, to his rise to MTV popularity and persistent struggle with personal demons. In addition to being visually very striking, with astoundingly economical prose McClanahan manages to deal with powerful and complex issues, such as how we as a society mythologize troubled artists, while continuing his ongoing exploration of human relationships, and the pliable interaction between reader and writer.\n\n5.\nTitle: Black Raising Cane Over Red: The Poems\nScore 0-1: 0.9998605251312256\nDescription: BLACK RAISING CANE OVER RED Evolved partly from a principle practiced at The World Stage Anassi Writer's workshop. Honor the truth. From that single premise sprang the idea of sharing my personal story and familial history through poetry. That,coupled with growing up in such a colorful time and place like Detroit during the sixties provides historical context that transcends the very essence of this wonderful art form. Mrs. Kirk, my high school English teacher was extremely influential in shaping not only my approach to a literary standard but also the level of commitment imparted to the pursuit of the actual craft. The painting on the front cover of the book is an original work of art created by Carl Overr. The front and rear book cover was designed by Azaan Kamau. Visit Jawanza At: http://jawanzadumisani.wix.com/jawanz... Who is Jawanza? A native Detroiter, Jawanza Dumisani's first full length collection of poems, Black Raising Cane Over Red, celebrates Detroit's turbulent era with provocative fondness. From street wise game to dope house drama, his eloquent, yet gritty style transports you back in time with switchblade precision. Beautifully spun narratives weave a tapestry that plunks you smack dab in the midst of Motown gladness while sharing the intimacy of his family tree. This stunning collection is part I of a two-book project chronicling his early youth followed by Urban Miaffa in 2015, a photo journey documenting Detroit's current struggle to not only survive, but re-emerge from a half century of decay spawned by the civil unrest of the sixties. A perfect coffee table companion, complimented by excerpts from Jawanza's poignant verse and more. Both on Glover Lane Press.
