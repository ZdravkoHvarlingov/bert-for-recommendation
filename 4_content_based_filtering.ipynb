Meet Bingo and J'miah, raccoon brothers on a mission to save Sugar Man Swamp in this rollicking tale and National Book Award Finalist from Newbery Honoree Kathi Appelt. Raccoon brothers Bingo and J'miah are the newest recruits of the Official Sugar Man Swamp Scouts. The opportunity to serve the Sugar Man--the massive creature who delights in delicious sugar cane and magnanimously rules over the swamp--is an honor, and also a big responsibility, since the rest of the swamp critters rely heavily on the intel of these hardworking Scouts. Twelve-year-old Chap Brayburn is not a member of any such organization. But he loves the swamp something fierce, and he'll do anything to help protect it. And help is surely needed, because world-class alligator wrestler Jaeger Stitch wants to turn Sugar Man swamp into an Alligator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park, and the troubles don't end there. There is also a gang of wild feral hogs on the march, headed straight toward them all. The Scouts are ready. All they have to do is wake up the Sugar Man. Problem is, no one's been able to wake that fellow up in a decade or four... Newbery Honoree and Kathi Appelt's story of care and conservation has received five starred reviews, was selected as a National Book Award finalist, and is funny as all get out and ripe for reading aloud.\n",

      "Description: Part of the \"My Story\" series. Set in Sydney, 1937, this is the fictional diary of a young Aboriginal girl, a member of the Stolen Generation. She is given the diary by the Sister in charge of Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home and through its pages she describes her life - from her arrival there, aged five, through her struggle to understand why she was taken from her real mother, to her adoption at ten years of age by a white Catholic family in St.Ives. Mary Talence, birth name Amy Charles, is increasingly confused - and then ashamed - as she is taught that white skinned is good, black skinned is bad. She longs to understand why this is so but finds that logical questions - almost any questions - provoke anger and accusations of ingratitude from her white family. Her music - her beautiful voice and her ability to make up songs - is her greatest source of comfort. This is an honest, thought-provoking book that acknowledges the terrible wrong done to aboriginal children taken from their families whilst also recognising the combination of ignorance, genuinely good intentions and political convenience that brought about this dreadful policy. Very appropriate for integration with HSIE and highly recommended for general reading as a clear introduction to the reality of the Stolen Generations to primary students.\n",

      "Description: The Inhumans are one of Marvel's most enduring oddities. A race of genetic freaks living secluded in their island kingdom of Attilan, their mutations are self-endowed; as a coming of age ritual, each Inhuman exposes themself to the Terrigen Mists, a strange substance that imparts unearthly powers...some extraordinary, some monstrous. But now Attilan is under attack from without and within. Can the Royal Family, led by the mute Black Bolt, repel the foreign invaders who assail their outer defense, as well as the internal threat of Black Bolt's insane brother, Maximus the Mad? Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee infuse one of Marvel's oldest families with a modern sensibility, including international politics, class struggles and the age-old struggle of growing up. Dark and grimly compelling, it remains one of Marvel Knights' most beloved stories. COLLECTING:Inhumans (1998) 1-12\n",
